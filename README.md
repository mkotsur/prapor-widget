# Raise the flag ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

The flag of Ukraine (Ukrainian: ÐŸÑ€Ð°Ð¿Ð¾Ñ€ Ð£ÐºÑ€Ð°Ñ—Ð½Ð¸, romanized: Prapor Ukrainy) consists of equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow. The combination of blue and yellow as a symbol of Ukraine comes from the flag of the Kingdom of Galiciaâ€“Volhynia used in the 12th century.

Add a banner to your web page and publicly show support and recognition to the people of Ukraine: millions of refugees, hundreds of thousands of military personnel, thousands injured and killed.
